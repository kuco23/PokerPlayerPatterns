PokerPlayerPatterns (PPP)
-------------------------

This is a project which focuses on analysing 
the poker game dataset, which should give us 
some insight into patterns created by users.

We aim to represent every round, which includes 
gathering the following information:
- featured players ids
- money put in the game at every turn
- player actions at every turn
- player hands if revealed

Using this information hopefully we can execute
the following actions:
- analyse specific player's behaviour
- classify player into a certain subgroup
- determine the best player

The datasets used are provided by 
kaggle.com at (1).

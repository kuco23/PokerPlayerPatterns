PokerPlayerPatterns (PPP)
-------------------------

This is a project which focuses on 
analysing the poker game dataset 
provided, which should give us some 
insight into patterns created by 
users.

Using those patterns hopefully we 
can predict a player's behaviour 
and classify him into a subgroup.

The datasets used are provided by 
kaggle.com at (1).
